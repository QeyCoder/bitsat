Limitation

Python based string replace are different from java as string is immutatble here so regex will not work so to handle this I have written loop based approach to replace value

Run applicaiton:
1 . To run  application file need to be compiled
        javac CsvFormatter.java
2. Run
        java CsvFormatter <filepath>
3. Output would be in same folder where  CsvFormatter.java file exist
